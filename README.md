# Alarm-App



listing the problems :
1/ how can we retreve a string that contanes the timme then convert it to atime variable in java to compear it withe the actul toime in the device 
2/ the variable of the statue is a bool not a stringin the data base 
3/time converson am and pm problem they are all srtring in the table 
4/gtig a list of alarms is esy but activation all of ther servesses in the saame time wille be defntly a problem 
6/starting a serves on its owne is kinda hard and this project is not ganna be finished in time 
7/we didnt think of how a user wold edit or delete an alarme 
8/the serves will call the data base evry time you start itand see witch alarm is active 
9/we will be needing to make serves starts every time you make a nbew alarme 
10/ that will lead to multy thredded serves ya3ni starting many servesses in the app and that needs a lot of time in programmin 
11/serveses cant be destroid only from inside the serves so the deactivate butten must be managed from inside the servce but its in another intant 
/a problem of notificaton and of permissons that shuld be givven and asked to make the sonnory workes 
/andother prooblem if you think of how to stop the notificaton, or the sonnory, your bascly starting another app within a serves 
12/among other problrmes becose we dont know evrything about the serves 

soooo we need to change the app or the subject 
a chronomerter will be better and eser 
we set a itme and hit start to start couting 
we leave the app and go bake to find it still counting downe when we close the app and whe we go back it still works 
reset opton is avlbel to edidt the time to count down
